It is our great pleasure to announce the first **Taming the BEAST in China!** It will take place in **Beijing, July 14-18, 2025**.

As in previous workshops, the goal is to offer a broad overview of everything that can be done with BEAST2, demonstrate best practices, and offer detailed advice to participants on their own dataset.
The registration fee is set to **1500 CNY** (approx 200€), and includes all meals during the workshop. Applications will open soon on this website!

For any further questions, please contact the organizing committee at [ttb.beijing@ivpp.ac.cn](mailto:ttb.beijing@ivpp.ac.cn).
