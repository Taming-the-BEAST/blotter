The sixth Taming the BEAST workshop was held last week at Quest University in Squamish, British Columbia. Thanks to all of the invited speakers, instructors and participants for making it a very enjoyable experience! I hope all of the participants enjoyed it as much as we did! A huge thank you also to Francois Cholette and Jeffrey Joy for organising a fantastic workshop in a stunning location! 

The lecture slides and tutorials used during the workshop are available online from the
