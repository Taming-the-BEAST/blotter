title: Taming the BEAST comes to London!
author: Louis du Plessis

We are happy to announce that the next installment of Taming the BEAST will be in London, where it will be hosted by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine! Thanks to Stephane Hue for organising!

The workshop will take place from 24-28 July this year and will cost Â£240. Unlike previous workshops the fee does **NOT** include accommodation. It's the first time we are holding a workshop in a big city and it proved just too complicated to book a venue with accommodation, so we ask that participants arrange their own accommodation.

For more information visit the workshop's [homepage](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/events/2017/07/taming-the-beast-2017).

[Registration](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/taming-the-beast-2017-workshop-on-bayesian-phylogenetic-and-phylodynamics-analyses-registration-33205687104) will be open until 26 June. 

A preliminary programme will be posted on the [workshops](/workshops/Taming-the-BEAST-in-London/) soon.
