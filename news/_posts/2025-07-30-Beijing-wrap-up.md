The 9th Taming the BEAST workshop was held this July at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing, China. Huge thanks to all of our invited speakers, instructors and participants for making the event a success! Special thanks to Chi Zhang and his team at IVPP for taking care of everything (including our delicious meals) and making everyone feel so welcome in Beijing! 

The lecture slides and tutorials used during the workshop are available online from the links displayed on the [workshop programme](https://taming-the-beast.org/workshops/2025-Beijing/index.html).
