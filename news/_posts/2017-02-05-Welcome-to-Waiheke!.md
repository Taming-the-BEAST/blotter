The next Taming the BEAST workshop is officially about to start, on the beautiful Waiheke island, in the Hauruki Gulf of New Zealand! This time the workshop was organised by Alexei Drummond's [group](https://www.compevol.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) at the University of Auckland. 
The workshop program can be found [here](/workshops/Taming-the-BEAST-in-the-South-Pacific/). 

To prepare for the workshop we also uploaded 5 (five!) new tutorials and updated several of the older tutorials. The new tutorials are:

- [Divergence Time Estimation using BEAST v2.x](/tutorials/FBD-tutorial/)
- [Bacter Tutorial](/tutorials/Bacter-Tutorial/)
- [Species Trees with Relaxed Molecular Clocks](/tutorials/species-tree-clocks/)
- [Calibrated Species Trees](/tutorials/calibrated-species-trees/)
- [Model adequacy using BEAST2](/tutorials/adequacy_tutorial/)

Thanks to Tim Vaughan, Walter Xie, Remco Bouckaert, Huw Ogilvie, David DuchÃªne and Simon Ho for their help preparing and checking tutorials! 

I would also like to congratulate Tanja Stadler and her [group](https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cevo) for successfully writing a grant to host another Taming the BEAST workshop and to support 3 more workshops in the future! Keep checking the [workshops](/workshops/) page for updates on future workshops!
