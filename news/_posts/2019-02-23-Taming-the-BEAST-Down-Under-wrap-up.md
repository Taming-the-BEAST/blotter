The fifth Taming the BEAST workshop was held last week at the University of Sydney, Australia.
An enormous thank you goes to all of the speakers and participants for making this once again
such an enjoyable and productive event!

All of the lecture slides and tutorials used during the workshop are available online from the
links displayed on the [workshop programme]({{site.baseurl}}/workshops/Taming-the-BEAST-Down-Under/).
