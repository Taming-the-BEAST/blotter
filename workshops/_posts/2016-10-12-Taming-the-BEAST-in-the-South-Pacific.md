# Required Software

**You are required to bring your own laptop to the workshop.** Power strips are available for each participant to keep their devices charged during the workshop. The software below **must** be installed prior to arrival. 

### BEAST 2

BEAST2 is a cross-platform program for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences. We will be using this software to perform analyses on the data brought to the workshop. We will be using BEAST v2.4.5 for the workshop.

[Download](http://beast2.org/)

### FigTree

FigTree is a graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees, specificly designed to display summarized and annotated trees produced by BEAST. Allows visual analysis of trees.

[Download](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)

### Tracer

Tracer is a program for analysing the trace files generated by Bayesian MCMC runs. It can be used to check mixing, ESS, parameter corellations, etc.

[Download](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)


### R

R is a free software environment that provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

[Download](https://www.r-project.org/)


### Java 8 JDK

This Java SE Developlment Kit is required for BEAST 2.

[Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)


### RStudio (optional)

RStudio IDE is a user interface for R.
