# General guidelines
- The tutorial should be a self-contained unit and needs to contain, in addition to the tutorial itself,
	- All data files used in the tutorial
	- Example BEAST2 XML files
	- Example output files from running the XML files in BEAST2
	- Any scripts needed for pre- or post-processing
- It should be possible to work through the tutorial in roughly an hour
- At the beginning of the tutorial the question or type of analysis the tutorial is for should be clearly stated
- The tutorial should contain enough background information to motivate why particular methods are being used
- The tutorial should contain a small section describing the data used in the tutorial
- The tutorial should contain a section that explains how to interpret the results


# Attribution and licensing
- All authors should be added to the yaml header of `README.md`
- If your tutorial is based on a previous tutorial written by someone else please clearly state this and add a citation/link to the previous tutorial.
- If your tutorial makes use of models that do not form part of the BEAST2 core, please cite the relevant papers and packages!
- Information about the license should be added at the end of the tutorial (We require that all tutorials be licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).


# Common-sense guidelines
- Keep the data files small. It is for demonstration purposes only and should not take too much space or take too long to run. 
- Do not add figures that are unnecessarily large.
